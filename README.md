# citi-ezVerify
Our team aims to make SMS OTPs simpler and safer. Current SMS OTP verifications are lengthy and full of numbers, and it is not uncommon for multiple attempts due to a wrong input or perhaps poor eyesight. We dream of transforming this process into a simple click of the button and scan of your face! By generating a link that leads to FaceID/TouchID authentication for payment requests, users can simply click the link to authenticate their payments. In today's world where time is of essence, a convenient and fun feature like this is definitely a possibility in the near future. After the campaign is over, we plan to build upon this project by further implementing our prototype into mobile devices, in order to test out actual FaceID/TouchID authentication. If successful, the idea can then by tested on a pilot run, together with the help of banks.
